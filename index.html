    <meta name="description" content="HoloLearn 2D to 3D Converter is an intelligent system that transforms ordinary two-dimensional images into interactive three-dimensional models. The converter uses AI-based depth estimation to analyze the visual structure of a 2D image and predict depth information, which is then used to generate a 3D mesh. This allows flat images to be visualized with realistic height, shape, and perspective.

The generated 3D models can be rotated, zoomed, and viewed from different angles, making learning more immersive and engaging. HoloLearn is especially useful in education, virtual labs, and digital visualization, where users can better understand objects, concepts, and structures by interacting with them in 3D rather than viewing static images.">
